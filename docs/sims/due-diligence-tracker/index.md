## How to Use

- **Check items** in each workstream as due diligence progresses
- **Monitor progress bars** for visual completion tracking
- **Watch the Deal Risk Score** — it changes based on critical uncompleted items
- Use this as a template for your own due diligence tracking

## About the Workstreams

This tracker covers the seven core due diligence workstreams in M&A transactions:

1. **Financial** — Verify financial statements, revenue quality, and cash flow
2. **Legal** — Review contracts, compliance, litigation, and corporate structure
3. **Operational** — Assess business processes, supply chain, and customer concentration
4. **Technology/IP** — Inventory intellectual property and evaluate tech infrastructure
5. **Human Capital** — Review organizational structure, key personnel, and HR compliance
6. **Tax** — Verify tax compliance and identify potential liabilities
7. **Environmental** — Assess environmental compliance and potential liabilities

Items marked as **CRITICAL** have the greatest impact on deal risk scoring. Incomplete critical items significantly increase the overall risk assessment.
