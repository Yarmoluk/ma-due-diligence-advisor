# Glossary

## A-D

**Accretion/Dilution Analysis**: Financial analysis determining whether an acquisition increases (accretive) or decreases (dilutive) the acquirer's earnings per share. Accretive transactions improve EPS, while dilutive transactions reduce EPS.

**Asset Purchase**: Transaction structure where the buyer purchases specific assets and assumes selected liabilities, rather than purchasing the legal entity. Allows buyer to cherry-pick assets while avoiding unwanted liabilities.

**Break-up Fee**: Fee paid by the target company to the buyer if the target accepts a competing offer or terminates the agreement under specified circumstances. Compensates buyer for transaction expenses and opportunity cost.

**Carve-out**: Divestiture where a parent company sells a complete or partial stake in a subsidiary, often through an IPO while retaining some ownership.

**Change of Control**: Transaction clause triggered when ownership or control of a company changes hands, often giving counterparties specific rights (consent requirements, termination rights, price adjustments).

**Comparable Companies Analysis**: Valuation method comparing the target to similar publicly traded companies using valuation multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E ratio).

**Data Room**: Secure physical or virtual location where confidential company information is made available to potential buyers during due diligence. Virtual data rooms (VDRs) are standard in modern M&A.

**DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)**: Intrinsic valuation methodology projecting future free cash flows and discounting them to present value using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

**Due Diligence**: Comprehensive investigation and analysis of a target company conducted by a potential acquirer to validate assumptions, identify risks, and inform valuation and deal structuring.

## E-L

**Earnout**: Purchase price component paid contingent upon the acquired business achieving specified financial or operational targets post-close. Bridges valuation gaps and aligns buyer-seller incentives.

**EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: Commonly used profitability metric representing cash earnings from core operations before capital structure, tax, and non-cash accounting impacts.

**Enterprise Value**: Total value of a company's operations, calculated as equity value plus net debt (debt minus cash) plus other claims (minority interest, preferred stock). Represents the theoretical takeover price.

**Equity Value**: Market value of a company's equity (common stock), representing the value attributable to shareholders after accounting for debt and other claims.

**Escrow**: Funds held by a third party at closing to satisfy potential post-close adjustments or indemnification claims. Provides security for buyer's claims without requiring collection efforts against sellers.

**Friendly Merger**: Transaction where the target company's board approves the acquisition and recommends shareholders accept the offer.

**Goodwill**: Accounting concept representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Reflects intangible value such as brand, customer relationships, and workforce.

**Holdback**: Portion of purchase price withheld at closing to satisfy potential adjustments or claims. Similar to escrow but retained by buyer rather than third party.

**Hostile Takeover**: Acquisition attempt where the buyer makes an offer directly to shareholders without target board approval or despite board opposition.

**Indemnification**: Purchase agreement provision requiring sellers to compensate buyers for losses resulting from breaches of representations and warranties or specified risks. Risk allocation mechanism.

**Integration**: Post-close process of combining acquired company with buyer's operations, systems, and culture to realize synergies and achieve acquisition objectives.

**LBO (Leveraged Buyout)**: Acquisition financed primarily with debt, using the target company's assets and cash flows as collateral. Typically pursued by private equity firms seeking high returns through financial leverage.

**Letter of Intent (LOI)**: Non-binding agreement outlining key transaction terms (price, structure, timing, exclusivity) before comprehensive due diligence and definitive documentation. Signals serious intent while preserving flexibility.

## M-P

**Management Buyout (MBO)**: LBO where the target company's existing management team participates as equity investors, partnering with financial sponsors to acquire the business.

**Material Adverse Change (MAC)**: Condition allowing a buyer to terminate a transaction if specified adverse events occur before closing. Heavily negotiated provision defining extraordinary circumstances releasing buyer from obligation.

**Net Debt**: Total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. Used to adjust enterprise value to equity value: Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt.

**No-Shop Clause**: Agreement provision prohibiting the target from soliciting or entertaining competing offers during a specified exclusivity period. Protects buyer's diligence investment.

**Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**: Confidentiality agreement executed before sharing sensitive information, establishing obligations to maintain confidentiality and restrictions on information use.

**Normalized Earnings**: Historical earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, accounting irregularities, and other factors to reflect sustainable ongoing earnings power. Foundation for valuation.

**Precedent Transaction Analysis**: Valuation method examining multiples paid in recent comparable acquisitions. Reflects control premiums and synergy expectations built into acquisition pricing.

**Pro Forma**: Financial statements showing how combined company financials would appear "as if" the transaction had occurred at an earlier date, incorporating adjustments for the transaction.

**Purchase Price Allocation**: Accounting process allocating transaction purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities at fair value, with excess recorded as goodwill.

## Q-Z

**Quality of Earnings (QoE)**: Financial due diligence process normalizing historical earnings to reflect sustainable earnings power, identifying non-recurring items and accounting quality issues.

**Representations and Warranties**: Seller statements about the condition of the business included in the purchase agreement. Form the basis for indemnification claims if breached.

**Reverse Merger**: Transaction where a private company acquires a public shell company, becoming publicly traded without conducting an IPO.

**Run-Rate**: Annualized projection of financial results based on current period performance. Used to project full-year results from partial-year data or to reflect impact of recent changes.

**Spin-off**: Divestiture where a parent company distributes subsidiary shares to existing shareholders as a dividend, creating an independent publicly traded entity.

**Stock Purchase**: Transaction structure where the buyer purchases the target company's outstanding shares, acquiring the legal entity with all assets, liabilities, and obligations.

**Synergy**: Value created through the combination of two companies that couldn't be achieved separately. Includes revenue synergies (cross-selling, market expansion) and cost synergies (overhead elimination, vendor consolidation).

**Tender Offer**: Acquisition structure where the buyer offers to purchase shares directly from target company shareholders, typically at a premium to market price.

**WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)**: Blended cost of a company's debt and equity capital, weighted by the proportion of each in the capital structure. Used as the discount rate in DCF valuation.

**Working Capital**: Operating liquidity required to run the business day-to-day, typically defined as current assets (excluding cash) minus current liabilities (excluding debt). Purchase agreements establish working capital targets with adjustment mechanisms if actual closing working capital differs.
