# Operational Due Diligence

## Evaluating Business Model Sustainability and Execution Capability

Operational due diligence assesses the target company's business model viability, competitive positioning, operational efficiency, customer relationships, supply chain resilience, and organizational capability to execute its strategy. While financial due diligence validates historical performance, operational due diligence evaluates whether that performance is sustainable and scalable under new ownership.

### Business Model Analysis

Understanding how the company creates, delivers, and captures value provides the foundation for assessing operational health and growth potential.

#### Revenue Model Assessment

Analyze primary and secondary revenue sources, one-time vs. recurring revenue mix, product sales vs. service revenue, and geographic and customer segment distribution. Evaluate pricing strategy (cost-plus vs. value-based vs. competitive pricing), price realization patterns, and pricing power indicators.

Assess the sales model: direct sales force vs. channel partners vs. self-service, sales cycle length and conversion rates, customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV), and sales productivity metrics.

!!! example "Business Model Red Flags"
    Warning signs include: declining price realization despite stated pricing power, increasing reliance on non-recurring revenue to hit targets, extending payment terms to close deals, growing gap between bookings and revenue recognition, and deteriorating CAC to LTV ratio suggesting customer acquisition economics are breaking down.

#### Value Proposition Evaluation

Identify core benefits delivered to customers (cost savings, revenue enablement, risk reduction, convenience), quantification of customer ROI or payback period, and differentiation from competitive alternatives. Assess switching costs and stickiness: integration complexity, training investment, contract terms, and network effects or ecosystem lock-in.

### Customer Concentration and Relationships

Customer analysis identifies revenue stability, concentration risk, and relationship health critical to forecasting future performance.

#### Customer Concentration Analysis

Calculate concentration metrics: top 10 customers as percentage of revenue, customer cohort contribution, new vs. existing customer revenue, and any single customer exceeding 10% of revenue.

Assess concentration risk through contract terms with large customers (duration, renewal probability, termination provisions), relationship depth (single buyer vs. multiple stakeholders), and customer financial health and business trajectory.

!!! warning "Customer Concentration Risk"
    If a single customer represents >20% of revenue, investigate thoroughly: Is there a long-term contract? What's the relationship quality? Are there alternatives if this customer is lost? High concentration warrants purchase price adjustment, earnout structure protecting buyer, or pre-close customer commitment.

#### Customer Retention and Churn

Evaluate retention metrics: gross retention rate, net revenue retention (including expansions and contractions), churn rate by customer cohort and tenure, and reasons for customer departures. Assess customer satisfaction through Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer references, online reviews, complaint volume, and service level agreement attainment.

### Supply Chain Assessment

Supply chain analysis evaluates the company's ability to source materials, produce products, and deliver services reliably and cost-effectively.

#### Supplier Analysis

Identify critical suppliers and single-source dependencies. Calculate top 10 suppliers as percentage of cost of goods sold. Assess alternative supplier availability and switching costs. Evaluate supplier financial stability and capacity constraints.

Review supplier relationships including contract terms, payment terms, supplier satisfaction, and historical delivery performance. Assess supply chain resilience: geographic concentration and geopolitical risks, inventory buffers for critical components, dual sourcing strategies, and supply chain disruption history.

!!! tip "Supplier Risk Mitigation"
    Identify critical single-source suppliers and assess: Can the company switch suppliers without major disruption? What would switching cost in time and expense? Are there alternative sources available? Consider requiring seller to secure supply agreements pre-close.

#### Manufacturing and Production

For product companies, assess manufacturing capability: current utilization rates and available capacity, scalability to support growth projections, capacity expansion requirements, and seasonality management.

Evaluate production efficiency: manufacturing yield rates and scrap/rework percentages, cycle times and throughput, direct labor productivity trends, and automation opportunities. Review quality management: quality control processes, defect rates, customer returns and warranty claims, and quality certifications.

### Facilities and Equipment

Physical assets supporting operations require assessment of condition, capacity, and capital requirements.

#### Real Estate Assessment

For owned real estate: property appraisals, environmental site assessments (Phase I, Phase II if needed), property condition reports, zoning compliance, and property taxes.

For leased facilities: lease terms and expiration dates, lease rates vs. market comparables, landlord relationship, lease assignment provisions, and leasehold improvement ownership.

Assess facility adequacy: space utilization and capacity for growth, layout efficiency, location suitability (labor availability, logistics), and safety/environmental compliance.

!!! info "Sale-Leaseback Considerations"
    Some sellers execute sale-leaseback transactions before closing to monetize real estate separately. Evaluate whether resulting leases reflect market terms or above-market rates that effectively inflate purchase price.

#### Equipment and Machinery

Review equipment inventory with age, condition, and replacement cost. Distinguish owned vs. leased vs. financed equipment. Assess equipment utilization rates, maintenance programs, breakdown frequency and downtime impact, and equipment failure risks.

Calculate capital expenditure requirements: maintenance capex to sustain current operations, growth capex for expansion, technology refresh cycles, and historical capex spend vs. depreciation expense.

### Information Technology Infrastructure

Technology assessment spans systems, infrastructure, applications, and IT organization capability.

#### Systems and Applications

Review core business systems: ERP system and version, CRM platform, financial and accounting software, and industry-specific applications. Assess system age, vendor support status, and upgrade path.

Evaluate system integration architecture, data flows between systems, manual workarounds, and data quality consistency. Balance custom vs. commercial software and assess custom application maintainability.

!!! warning "Legacy Technology Risk"
    Systems running on unsupported versions, proprietary platforms with vendor lock-in, or critical custom applications maintained by single individuals represent significant operational risk. Quantify the cost and timeline to modernize technology if integration or system replacement is necessary post-close.

#### IT Infrastructure

Assess infrastructure components: data center and server infrastructure (on-premise, colocation, cloud), network architecture, storage and backup systems, and disaster recovery capabilities.

Review cloud adoption: workloads migrated to cloud vs. on-premise, cloud service providers and spend, cloud governance and cost management, and hybrid architecture complexity.

Evaluate IT security: firewall and intrusion detection systems, endpoint protection and patch management, access controls and identity management, and security incident history.

### Key Person Dependencies

Many businesses depend heavily on specific individuals whose departure would significantly impact performance.

#### Key Person Identification

Identify critical roles: founder/owner with customer relationships or operational expertise, top sales producers, technical experts with specialized knowledge, and key operational managers.

Assess dependency level: revenue or operations tied to specific individuals, documentation of their knowledge and processes, bench strength and succession planning, and retention risk assessment.

!!! example "Founder Dependence"
    Many small and mid-sized businesses are highly dependent on founder relationships, expertise, and decision-making. Assess: Can the business operate without the founder? Are customer relationships transferable? Is institutional knowledge documented? Plan for founder transition period and knowledge transfer.

#### Retention Planning

For identified key persons: evaluate current compensation vs. market rates, review change of control and retention bonus structures, assess employment agreements and non-compete provisions, clarify post-close roles, and consider equity vesting arrangements.

### Competitive Positioning

Understanding the competitive landscape and the company's position within it informs sustainability of market share and profitability.

#### Competitive Landscape

Identify direct competitors (similar products, same customers), competitor market share and positioning, competitor strengths and weaknesses, and competitive intensity. Assess indirect competition and substitutes: alternative solutions to customer problems, disruptive threats from new entrants or technologies, and customer in-sourcing vs. outsourcing trends.

Evaluate competitive dynamics: market growth rate and maturity, industry consolidation trends, pricing pressure and margin trends, and barriers to entry protecting existing players.

#### Competitive Advantages

Assess sustainable differentiation: product/service features valued by customers, brand recognition and reputation, proprietary technology or intellectual property, operational efficiency and cost structure, customer relationships and switching costs, and distribution network or channel access.

Evaluate competitive position sustainability: How easily can competitors replicate advantages? What investment is required to maintain differentiation? What trends are strengthening or eroding competitive position?

!!! tip "Porter's Five Forces"
    Apply Michael Porter's Five Forces framework: (1) threat of new entrants, (2) bargaining power of suppliers, (3) bargaining power of customers, (4) threat of substitutes, and (5) competitive rivalry. This structured analysis reveals industry attractiveness and sustainability of profit margins.

### Operational Efficiency and Benchmarking

Comparing operational metrics to industry benchmarks identifies efficiency opportunities and risks.

#### Operational Metrics

Review productivity metrics: revenue per employee, units produced per labor hour, sales per square foot, utilization rates. Assess efficiency metrics: gross margin and contribution margin by product/service, SG&A as percentage of revenue, operating leverage.

Evaluate growth efficiency: customer acquisition cost (CAC), LTV:CAC ratio, sales efficiency (new revenue per sales headcount), marketing efficiency (pipeline generated per marketing spend).

Compare target company performance to public company comparables, private company industry data, prior acquisition targets, and buyer's own operations if applicable. Significant variance from benchmarks warrants investigation.

### Scalability Assessment

Evaluate whether the business can grow efficiently without proportional increases in cost structure.

Assess fixed vs. variable cost structure, operating leverage and break-even analysis, and cost structure flexibility in downside scenarios.

Identify capacity constraints: current capacity utilization across functions, bottlenecks limiting growth, scalability of systems and processes, and investment required to support projected growth.

Evaluate organizational scalability: management team capability to lead larger organization, formal processes vs. informal/heroic individual efforts, documented procedures and institutional knowledge, and decision rights clarity.

### Key Takeaways

Operational due diligence evaluates the sustainability and scalability of the target company's business model. Customer concentration, supplier relationships, facility condition, IT infrastructure, key person dependencies, and competitive positioning directly affect the company's ability to deliver projected performance. Thorough operational assessment identifies value creation opportunities, risks requiring mitigation, and potential deal-breakers, informing valuation, deal structure, and integration planning essential to achieving acquisition objectives.
