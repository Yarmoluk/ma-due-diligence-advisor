# Frequently Asked Questions

## Fundamental Concepts

### What is due diligence in M&A?

Due diligence is the comprehensive investigation and analysis process conducted by a potential acquirer to validate the target company's financial performance, legal status, operational capabilities, and strategic fit. The process identifies risks, validates assumptions underlying valuation, uncovers value creation opportunities, and informs deal structuring and purchase agreement terms. Due diligence typically occurs after signing a letter of intent (LOI) and before executing definitive purchase agreements.

### What's the difference between enterprise value and equity value?

Enterprise value represents the total value of a company's operations, independent of capital structure. It's calculated as equity value plus net debt (debt minus cash). Equity value is the market value of common stock, representing the portion belonging to equity holders after accounting for debt and other claims.

Think of buying a house: the house price is like enterprise value (total value of the asset), while your down payment after accounting for the mortgage is like equity value (your actual ownership stake).

### How long does due diligence typically take?

Due diligence timelines vary based on transaction size, complexity, and urgency:

- **Small transactions (<$50M)**: 30-60 days
- **Mid-market transactions ($50-500M)**: 60-90 days
- **Large transactions (>$500M)**: 90-120+ days

Competitive auctions compress timelines while complex businesses with multiple entities, international operations, or regulatory issues extend timelines.

### What's the difference between a stock purchase and an asset purchase?

In a **stock purchase**, the buyer acquires the target company's outstanding shares, gaining ownership of the legal entity with all assets, liabilities, contracts, and obligations. This provides continuity but transfers all historical liabilities to the buyer.

In an **asset purchase**, the buyer selects specific assets and liabilities to acquire while leaving others with the seller. This provides selectivity but requires individual transfer of contracts, permits, and customer relationships. Asset purchases are more common for smaller transactions and divisions of larger companies.

## Financial Due Diligence

### What is quality of earnings analysis?

Quality of earnings (QoE) analysis normalizes historical financial performance to reflect the sustainable earnings power of the business under new ownership. This process identifies and adjusts for non-recurring items (one-time revenues or expenses), aggressive accounting policies, related party transactions at non-market terms, and other factors distorting reported results. The normalized EBITDA resulting from QoE analysis forms the foundation for applying valuation multiples.

### Why does working capital matter in M&A?

Working capital represents the operating liquidity required to run the business day-to-day. Purchase agreements typically establish a "normalized working capital" target based on historical averages, with the purchase price adjusted dollar-for-dollar if actual closing working capital differs from the target.

If a business historically requires $5M in working capital but only has $3M at closing, the purchase price is reduced by $2M (or seller must contribute additional working capital). This mechanism ensures the buyer receives a business with adequate operating capital.

### What are common quality of earnings red flags?

Critical warning signs include:

- Growing revenue but declining gross margins
- Increasing accounts receivable aging and days sales outstanding
- Large fourth-quarter adjustments or "hockey stick" quarterly patterns
- Frequent changes in accounting policies or estimates
- Material audit adjustments in recent periods
- Revenue recognition timing issues (bill-and-hold, side letters)
- Deferred expenses or maintenance creating artificially low current costs
- Cash flow significantly lagging EBITDA growth

## Legal and Operational Due Diligence

### What happens if a key customer contract has a change of control provision?

Many customer contracts contain change of control provisions requiring customer consent to assign the contract to the buyer. This creates risk that the customer could terminate or renegotiate terms following the acquisition.

Mitigation approaches include:
- Obtaining customer consent pre-close (requires careful confidentiality management)
- Including revenue protection in earnout structure (seller bears risk if customer departs)
- Purchase price holdback released after customer consent obtained
- Representation and warranty insurance covering loss of specific customers

Revenue associated with at-risk contracts should be discounted in valuation or excluded from projections.

### How do you assess cultural compatibility?

Cultural assessment uses multiple methods:

**Quantitative**: Employee engagement surveys, cultural attribute assessments (Competing Values Framework), Glassdoor and employer review analysis

**Qualitative**: Management interviews about decision-making philosophy and values, observation of meetings and communication patterns, review of artifacts (mission statements, office design, policies)

**Comparative**: Identify similarities and differences between buyer and target cultures, assess whether differences complement or conflict, determine integration approach (assimilation, preservation, blending)

Cultural due diligence is frequently underemphasized despite culture being consistently cited as a primary acquisition failure factor.

### What are the most common reasons acquisitions fail?

Research consistently identifies these failure factors:

1. **Overpayment**: Paying more than the business is worth or can justify through synergies
2. **Poor Strategic Fit**: Acquisition doesn't truly advance strategic objectives
3. **Integration Execution Failures**: Unable to realize projected synergies due to integration challenges
4. **Cultural Incompatibility**: Cultural clashes destroying collaboration and driving talent attrition
5. **Key Person Departures**: Loss of critical employees taking customer relationships and institutional knowledge
6. **Overestimated Synergies**: Projecting synergies that prove unachievable or take much longer than expected

Rigorous due diligence identifies these risks before closing, enabling informed walk-away decisions or risk mitigation strategies.

## Advanced Topics

### How do you structure an earnout to align buyer-seller incentives post-close?

Effective earnouts balance several considerations:

**Metric Selection**: EBITDA-based earnouts align with value creation but can be manipulated through expense allocation. Revenue-based earnouts are more objective but don't reward profitability. Customer retention earnouts address specific retention risks.

**Targets and Payout Structure**: Targets should be achievable (70-80% probability) to maintain seller motivation. Graduated payouts (partial payout for partial achievement) maintain incentive even if full targets aren't achieved.

**Timeline**: 1-2 year earnouts for operational metrics, 3-5 year earnouts for customer retention or product development milestones.

**Seller Involvement**: Sellers should have meaningful post-close operational authority to influence earnout metrics. Buyers should have final decision-making on strategic matters.

**Dispute Resolution**: Clear measurement methodology, audit rights, and arbitration provisions prevent post-close disputes.

### What's the difference between representations & warranties and indemnification?

**Representations and warranties** are seller statements about the condition of the business included in the purchase agreement (e.g., "all material contracts are listed in Schedule X," "there is no undisclosed litigation," "financial statements are accurate").

**Indemnification** is the seller's obligation to compensate the buyer for losses resulting from breaches of those representations or specified risks. Indemnification provisions include:

- **Survival periods**: How long reps survive post-close (typically 12-24 months for general reps, 3-7 years for tax and IP)
- **Baskets**: Minimum loss threshold before indemnification applies (deductible or tipping basket)
- **Caps**: Maximum aggregate indemnification liability (typically 10-25% of purchase price for general reps, sometimes unlimited for fraud, tax, IP)

### How do you value synergies and incorporate them into purchase price?

Synergy valuation follows a structured process:

1. **Identify Synergies**: Specific revenue opportunities (cross-selling, geographic expansion) and cost savings (overhead elimination, vendor consolidation)

2. **Quantify Value**: Annual run-rate value once fully implemented

3. **Estimate Timing**: Ramp period to full realization (revenue synergies typically 2-3 years, cost synergies 1-2 years)

4. **Probability Adjust**: Discount synergies by probability of realization (100% for certain cost synergies, 50-75% for uncertain revenue synergies)

5. **Calculate NPV**: Discount probability-adjusted synergies to present value

**Purchase Price Allocation**: Buyers and sellers typically split synergy value, with buyers capturing more value for difficult-to-achieve synergies and sellers capturing more for certain synergies. Competitive auctions shift more synergy value to sellers.

### What should be included in a 100-day integration plan?

A comprehensive 100-day plan includes:

**Weeks 1-2**: Day-one execution (payroll, system access, communications), employee orientation, customer outreach, integration team mobilization

**Weeks 3-4**: Operational deep-dives validating due diligence, cultural immersion, quick win identification, synergy validation

**Weeks 5-8**: Detailed workstream plans, organizational design finalization, technology roadmap, communication cadence

**Weeks 9-12**: Quick win implementation, synergy realization initiation, process harmonization, integration governance review

**Quick Wins**: Tangible value delivered within 90 days demonstrating acquisition benefits (vendor consolidation savings, immediate cross-selling, redundant subscription elimination, best practice sharing).

The plan should identify clear milestones, owners, success metrics, and risks for each initiative.

### How do you determine whether to integrate quickly or slowly?

Integration pacing depends on several factors:

**Favor Fast Integration When**:
- Primary objective is cost synergy realization
- Target company has operational or financial challenges requiring buyer stabilization
- Systems and processes are clearly inferior to buyer's
- Employee uncertainty is creating retention risk

**Favor Measured Integration When**:
- Target company has valuable culture or capabilities that integration could damage
- Business is performing well and "if it's not broken, don't fix it" applies
- Significant customer risk from integration disruption
- Buyer lacks experience with acquisitions of this type
- Cultural differences are substantial and require gradual adaptation

Best practice combines fast integration where synergies are clear and low-risk with patience where value could be destroyed by hasty integration.

### What is representations and warranties insurance and when should you use it?

Representations and warranties (R&W) insurance is a policy protecting buyers against losses from seller representation breaches (buy-side policies) or protecting sellers from indemnification claims (sell-side policies).

**Benefits**:
- Increases seller net proceeds by reducing escrows
- Provides longer survival periods and higher caps than seller indemnification
- Facilitates clean exits where sellers want complete liquidity at close
- Removes post-close disputes from buyer-seller relationship

**When to Use**:
- Private equity sellers seeking complete exit
- Multiple sellers with coordination challenges for indemnification claims
- Seller financially unable to support meaningful indemnification
- Competitive auctions where R&W insurance is market standard

**Limitations**: Policies exclude known issues, forward-looking statements, and certain risks (tax, pension underfunding). Buyers still need fundamental representations and should not rely solely on insurance.

### How do you handle international due diligence?

International acquisitions add complexity across all workstreams:

**Legal**: Different legal systems, regulatory requirements, labor laws, and contract enforceability. Requires local counsel in each jurisdiction.

**Tax**: Transfer pricing, cross-border tax issues, withholding taxes, tax treaty implications. Requires international tax advisors.

**Accounting**: Different accounting standards (IFRS vs. US GAAP), currency translation, consolidation issues.

**Cultural**: Language barriers, business practice differences, relationship-building expectations varying by culture.

**Operational**: Supply chain spanning multiple countries, expatriate employees, country-specific operational requirements.

**Due Diligence Execution**: On-site visits to international locations, local expert advisors, translation of documents, extended timelines for cross-border coordination.

International deals require experienced advisors, extended timelines, and cultural sensitivity throughout the process.
